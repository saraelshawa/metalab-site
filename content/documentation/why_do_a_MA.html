<h1>Why meta-analysis (MA)?</h1>
<p>For a quick overview on what are meta-analysis (MA), please watch this 3-minute video:</p>

<p>Meta-analyses (MAs) can be useful several purposes, including: (1) <em>theory building and evaluation</em> and (2) <em>practical decisions during study design</em>. This section starts with some basics on why MAs are more useful than single studies for those two purposes.</p>
<div id="why-are-single-studies-not-enough" class="section level4">
<h4>Why are single studies not enough?</h4>
<p>When thinking about development, we often look at published experiments testing whether infants have specific abilities, for example whether infants treat native vowels differently from non-native ones, and how those abilities change with age (for more details on this specific topic see [here] (/dataset/inphondb-native.html).</p>
<p>The results of a single experiment cannot answer those questions once and for all: Each experiment measures behavior of a set of infants in a very specific situation, which might not be generalizable to other situations. Moreover, there might be a measurement error in this one-time snapshot of reality. Finally, the literature likely contains some false positives and false negatives.</p>
<p>With a significance threshold alpha set to .05, every study we run has a 5% chance of telling us that infants can do something when this is not true - this is a <em>false positive</em>. This likelihood becomes bigger when researchers engage in seemingly innocent and possibly common practices that increase the chance of a false positive, such as running multiple analyses until one is significant. Some people even propose that most published literature consists of false positives!</p>
<p>With a beta set to .2, every study we run has a 20% chance of telling us that infants cannot do something when they actually can - this is a <em>false negative</em>. In fact, many studies are underpowered, so that a non-significant result is not due to a true lack of effect, but rather to lack of power to detect it.</p>
<p>None of these necessarily are due to bad intentions, wrongdoing, or even poor research practices. Reality is complex and thus any one study can only give us a single, noisy estimate.</p>

<h4>How can MAs help with heterogeneity?</h4>
<p>MAs may be the cheapest way to assess generalizability and test whether a certain factor matters. Instead of running 10 experiments, 1 on each vowel contrast, we collect 10 studies in the literature into a single analysis! If effects for e.g.Â native versus non-native vowels differ significantly in the literature as a whole, then we can be more confident that results will generalize to unobserved vowel contrasts.</p>

<h4>How can MAs help with false positives?</h4>
<p>Collecting many study results from different researchers is a way to try and make up for the possibility that biases influenced the outcome. We can even <em>use MAs to check for biases</em>, such as asking whether a suspicious number of p-values is just below the significance threshold or whether results are systematically skewed in one direction. Why biases matter is wonderfully illustrated here: <a href="http://www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias/" class="uri">http://www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias/</a>. Checking for biased results is a whole literature on its own, but as a start tools such as p-curving apps are easily available for every researcher. <a href="http://www.p-curve.com/" class="uri">http://www.p-curve.com/</a> or <a href="http://shinyapps.org/apps/p-checker/" class="uri">http://shinyapps.org/apps/p-checker/</a> are two well-documented examples.</p>

<h4>How can MAs help with false negatives?</h4>
<p>MAs help in 3 ways. By pooling data together, we may be able to <em>bring out a small effect</em> that was too difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Additionally, we often do not know about these non-significant findings because it is quite difficult to publish them. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186116">Community-augmented MAs</a> like those in MetaLab provide a home for <em>non-sexy results</em>, and allow researchers to benefit from the experience of others.</p>
<p>Finally, MAs help us in experiment design so we can <em>avoid false negatives due to low power</em>. When the size of an effect is known and with a fixed significance threshold, calculating power is straightforward. Here is a simulation of how all ingredients fit together: &lt;rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/&gt;.</p>

<h4>Can MAs help in other ways?</h4>
<p>The MAs in MetaLab can also help with <em>study design</em>, becodes often many design variables have been coded. Examples include the words or sounds used, how long trials were, etc. Instead of doing a tiresome literature review, you can find out what is the most common procedure or which is associated with the biggest effect.</p>
